# Board Game Geek Collection Browser

This React App allows you to browse your BGG Collection.  It was created as my Final Project for the [JS for WP Bootcamp](https://javascriptforwp.com/).

## Project Built with: [React + Material-UI + Firebase](https://github.com/Phoqe/react-material-ui-firebase)

[React + Material-UI + Firebase](https://github.com/Phoqe/react-material-ui-firebase) is an application skeleton for a typical [React](https://reactjs.org) project. With [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app) at its core, you can use it to bootstrap your projects and development environment with the same tooling. It comes bundled with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router).
